## Introduction

This project is a web application designed to store user inputted prices of products. It uses Next.js for server-side rendering, React for building user interfaces, Supabase to house PostgreSQL, PostgreSQL for storing and retrieving data, Supabase Auth for users, and Chart.js for rendering a visualization aid to compare prices.

## Features - WIP

-   **Add High-Level Folder**: You can start off by adding a folder structure to house specific items and their prices. Mostly for grouping and sorting purpose.
-   **Add Items and Prices**: Create new price entries that store the prices, name, tags to better sort and organize these items, and date of prices
-   **Compare**: Choose from a list of criteria you want to sort from. As a default, it'll display places of all items within a folder sorted by date and tags.
-   **Sign Up**: All users start of anonymous if they've never registered. Registration is consisted of validating an email through OTP, no password necessary. Signing up ensures you never lose access to data you've entered on this app. Unregistered users will still have data as long as cookie isn't cleared.
